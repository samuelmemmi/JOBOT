        <p>Jobot was born out of a desire to create and define a job search platform.
          A way that will try to "score" as close to the "taste" of the job seekers
          and find them a job that will meet most of their requirements. Jobot is a web application
          through which you can conduct a chat with a bot. During the chat, we will receive data
          from the user including the education and experience he has gained in the field
          where he is interested in working and the system is looking for the jobs they can
          match the data the user has provided. The goal is to find jobs
          more accurate without unnecessary flooding of jobs</p>
