Driven by a passion to help patients, the company collaborates with the world\u2019s leading clinicians and researchers to address unmet healthcare needs, working to improve patient outcomes and enhance lives. Headquartered in Irvine, California, Edwards Lifesciences has extensive operations in North America, Europe, Japan, Latin America and Asia and currently employs over 13,000 individuals worldwide.\n\nFor us, helping patients is not a slogan - it\u2019s our life\u2019s work. From developing devices that replace or repair a diseased heart valve to creating new technologies that monitor vital signs in the critical care setting, we focus on helping patients regain and improve the quality of their life.\n\nCOVID Vaccination Requirement\n\nEdwards is committed to complying with the requirements and guidance from our government authorities and to protecting our vulnerable patients and the healthcare providers who are treating them around the world. As such, all Healthcare Interacting positions require COVID-19 vaccination, which includes anyone who directly interfaces with patients and those who interact with healthcare providers as part of their role. If hired, as a condition of employment, you will be required to submit proof that you have been fully vaccinated for COVID-19, unless you request and are granted a medical or religious accommodation for exemption from the vaccination requirement. This vaccination requirement does not apply in countries where it is prohibited by law to impose vaccination. In countries where vaccines are less available, or other requirements exist, we may institute alternate measures that optimize patient safety and healthcare provider safety, which may include regular COVID testing or specific masking requirements.\n\nFor United States Applicants Only:\nEdwards is an Equal Opportunity/Affirmative Action employer including protected Veterans and individuals with disabilities.\nKnow your Rights: Workplace Discrimination is Illegal Poster\nDisability accommodation for employment applicants\nEdwards E-Verify\nFamily and Medical Leave Act (FMLA)\nEmployee Polygraph Protection Act (EPPA)\nPay Transparency NoticeShow more Report"}, {"company": "", "job": "Part-time/Hourly Medic/ Paramedic", "city": "Jerusalem", "date": "30d+", "rating": "", "link": "https://www.glassdoor.com/partner/jobListing.htm?pos=110&ao=1136043&s=58&guid=0000018626f1c26ea503535563b10fdc&src=GD_JOB_VIEW&t=SR&vt=w&cs=1_6609dd6d&cb=1676382023752&jobListingId=1006601222953&jrtk=3-1-1gp82fbuoj46m801-1gojf3glji7mo800-5abd1a2f94043ada-", "description": "EMA Care is seeking a medic to be an on-call emergency room advocate to join our team.
