To free them from needing to constantly put out fires.\nThat vision created the remote-first IT management software \u2013 enabling IT professionals to shift from reactive task takers to proactive problem solvers.\nNow operating from our beautiful offices on Rothchild in Tel Aviv, Atera is currently used by thousands and thousands of IT professionals all over the world (105+ countries).\nAs we rapidly grow, our goal remains the same: to transform the IT industry with revolutionary technology, while creating one of the happiest and healthiest work environments in the world.Show more Report"}, {"company": "Applied Materials", "job": "Application Engineer Student", "city": "Israel", "date": "30d+", "rating": "4.1", "link": "", "description": ""}, {"company": "Gotfriends", "job": "Security Researcher \u05dc\u05d7\u05d1\u05e8\u05ea \u05d0\u05d1\u05d8\u05d7\u05ea \u05de\u05d9\u05d3\u05e2 \u05d1\u05d9\u05e8\u05d5\u05e9\u05dc\u05d9\u05dd - \u05d0\u05e4\u05e9\u05e8\u05d5\u05ea \u05dc\u05de\u05e9\u05e8\u05d4 \u05d7\u05dc\u05e7\u05d9\u05ea \u05d0\u05d5 \u05de\u05dc\u05d0\u05d4!", "city": "Jerusalem", "date": "4d", "rating": "4.7", "link": "https://www.glassdoor.com/partner/jobListing.htm?pos=121&ao=1136043&s=58&guid=0000018631c07ccdaa2bd9a868a0785b&src=GD_JOB_VIEW&t=SR&vt=w&cs=1_7ecd58fc&cb=1676383010754&jobListingId=1008450584097&jrtk=3-1-1gp83dfpmj4ie801-1goos0vblgsqj800-dd20bc91b81bb9f6-", "description": "\u05de\u05d9\u05e7\u05d5\u05dd: \u05d9\u05e8\u05d5\u05e9\u05dc\u05d9\u05dd\n\u05ea\u05d9\u05d0\u05d5\u05e8 \u05d4\u05de\u05e9\u05e8\u05d4:\n\u05d0\u05e0\u05d7\u05e0\u05d5 \u05de\u05e1\u05e4\u05e7\u05d9\u05dd \u05e9\u05d9\u05e8\u05d5\u05ea\u05d9 \u05de\u05d7\u05e7\u05e8 Security \u05d1\u05ea\u05d7\u05d5\u05dd \u05d4\u05e1\u05d9\u05d9\u05d1\u05e8 \u05d4\u05d4\u05ea\u05e7\u05e4\u05d9 \u05dc\u05dc\u05e7\u05d5\u05d7\u05d5\u05ea \u05d3\u05d9\u05e1\u05e7\u05e8\u05d8\u05d9\u05d9\u05dd \u05d5\u05d7\u05d1\u05e8\u05d5\u05ea \u05e1\u05d8\u05d0\u05e8\u05d8\u05d0\u05e4 \u05de\u05d5\u05db\u05e8\u05d5\u05ea.\n\n\u05e0\u05e9\u05de\u05d7 \u05dc\u05e6\u05e8\u05e3 \u05d0\u05dc\u05d9\u05e0\u05d5 Security Researcher \u05dc\u05ea\u05e4\u05e7\u05d9\u05d3 \u05d4\u05db\u05d5\u05dc\u05dc \u05de\u05d7\u05e7\u05e8 Low Level \u05dcEmbedded \u05d0\u05d5 Mobile. \u05d9\u05e9\u05e0\u05d4 \u05d0\u05e4\u05e9\u05e8\u05d5\u05ea \u05d2\u05dd \u05dc\u05e9\u05dc\u05d1 \u05d4\u05d3\u05e8\u05db\u05d4 \u05d1\u05ea\u05d7\u05d5\u05dd \u05dc\u05d7\u05d5\u05e7\u05e8\u05d9\u05dd.\n\n\u05de\u05d5\u05e0\u05d9\u05dd 12 \u05e2\u05d5\u05d1\u05d3\u05d9\u05dd.\n\u05de\u05d5\u05db\u05df/\u05d4 \u05dc\u05d4\u05ea\u05d7\u05dc\u05d4 \u05d7\u05d3\u05e9\u05d4? \u05e9\u05dc\u05d7/\u05d9 \u05e7\u05d5\u05e8\u05d5\u05ea \u05d7\u05d9\u05d9\u05dd \u05d5\u05e0\u05db\u05d9\u05e8.\n\u05d3\u05e8\u05d9\u05e9\u05d5\u05ea \u05d4\u05de\u05e9\u05e8\u05d4:\n3 \u05e9\u05e0\u05d5\u05ea \u05e0\u05e1\u05d9\u05d5\u05df \u05db\u05d7\u05d5\u05e7\u05e8/\u05ea \u05d7\u05d5\u05dc\u05e9\u05d5\u05ea \u05dcEmbedded \u05d0\u05d5 Mobile\u05e0\u05e1\u05d9\u05d5\u05df \u05db Reverse EngineerShow more Report"}, {"company": "NVIDIA", "job": "Electro-Optical Lab Engineer (Contract)", "city": "Israel", "date": "13d", "rating": "4.6", "link": "https://www.glassdoor.com/partner/jobListing.htm?pos=122&ao=1136043&s=58&guid=0000018631c07ccdaa2bd9a868a0785b&src=GD_JOB_VIEW&t=SR&vt=w&cs=1_63695e49&cb=1676383012197&jobListingId=1008430685224&jrtk=3-1-1gp83dh95p6d7801-1goos0vblgsqj800-7add3fb0d0a3d905-", "description": "The Data Center System Engineering division of NVIDIA is seeking a contractor in electro-optics or physics to join the Advanced Development (AD) team in Yokneam.
