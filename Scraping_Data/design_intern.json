We innovate everywhere, taking bold risks to shape the technologies that give us smart cities, connected cars, and handheld hospitals. And we do it in style with unique personalities who aren\u2019t afraid to change the way the world works, lives, plays and learns. We are thought leaders, tech geeks, pop culture aficionados, and we even have a few purple haired rock stars. We celebrate the creativity and diversity that fuels our innovation. We are dreamers and we are doers. #We Are Cisco\n\nWHAT YOU'LL DO\nWe are looking for Software Engineer Intern to join the Security Policy Access (SPA) product development team. In this role you will work on design and implementation of ground-breaking new features and tackle critical customers issues in high scale enterprise production environments.\n\nWHO YOU'LL WORK WITH\nCisco is redefining the networking industry. To make this happen, we are heavily investing in team responsible for the Network. We are disrupting the industry by building a new networking platform that can learn, adapt, and secure itself at the speed of today\u2019s businesses. Cisco Digital Network Architecture platform automates network management and provides our customers with state-of-the-art analytics and insights. You will work with one of the most hardworking group of engineers in the industry, bringing innovation into the networking world.\n\nREQUIREMENTS\nStudent graduating in late 2023/early 2024 pursuing a BA/BSc in Computer Science or Software Engineering from Technion, Tel Aviv, Ben-Gurion or Hebrew University with a GPA of 85 or above- Strong software development skills in Java/C#/C++- Good understanding of standard networking protocols- Software development experience in Linux environment- Very good verbal and written communication skills (English) - Hands on experience with scripting languages (Python, Perl)- You are curious to learn new technologies and collaborate with fellow engineers to raise the bar to create team success\n\nWe understand from experience that not ticking every box on the skills sections stops many from applying. You should apply if you feel you are the right person for the job and have the aptitude to learn and deliver results.\n\n #WeAreCisco, where each person is unique, but we bring our talents to work as a team and make a difference powering an inclusive future for all. We embrace digital, and help our customers implement change in their digital businesses. Some may think we\u2019re \"old\" (36 years strong) and only about hardware, but we\u2019re also a software company. And a security company. We even invented an intuitive network that adapts, predicts, learns and protects. No other company can do what we do - you can\u2019t put us in a box!But \"Digital Transformation\" is an empty buzz phrase without a culture that allows for innovation, creativity, and yes, even failure (if you learn from it.)Day to day, we focus on the give and take. We give our best, give our egos a break, and give of ourselves (because giving back is built into our DNA.) We take accountability, bold steps, and take difference to heart. Because without diversity of thought and a dedication to equality for all, there is no moving forward.\nSo, you have colorful hair? Don\u2019t care. Tattoos? Show off your ink. Like polka dots? That\u2019s cool. Pop culture geek? Many of us are. Passion for technology and world changing?
